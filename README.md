# ðŸ“ˆ Sentiment-Driven Direct Indexing Portfolio Optimizer

## Description
This project is a web-based application built with Streamlit that optimizes investment portfolios using direct indexing, enhanced by sentiment analysis from news articles. Users can filter stocks by sectors, ESG scores, and other preferences, then optimize their portfolio based on historical returns adjusted by sentiment scores. The app provides visualizations like performance charts and allocation breakdowns, and generates a detailed PDF report summarizing the results.

The combination of sentiment-driven optimization, user-customizable filters, and reporting makes this project a unique showcase for my GitHub portfolio. As my first project here, it demonstrates skills in financial data analysis, web development, and sentiment processing, built as a hobby to explore these concepts.

## Features
- Select stocks from the S&P 500 or a predefined list, with sector and ESG filtering.
- Sentiment analysis of stock-related news using the News API and VADER.
- Portfolio optimization with PyPortfolioOpt, incorporating sentiment boosts.
- Visualizations including performance vs. SPY and allocation pie charts.
- Exportable CSV of optimized weights and a comprehensive PDF report.
